Instructions:

Left is player 1, right is player 2.
Plyare 1 controls:
Keys 1 to 5 to choose power, press space to shoot a wave, and W and S to move the shooter up and down (the black rectangle). Press Q to transmit.
Player 2 controls:
Numpad keys 1 to 5 to choose power, press left arrow to shoot a wave, up and down arrows to move the shooter up and down. Press right arrow to transmit.

The objective is to either transmit 50 times or shoot the other team's tower down. Each tower has 25 health. The power of the wave knocks
down the health of the other tower if it hits it. If a wave hits another wave:
  The wave with the larger power continues on with a power of the difference in original powers.
  The two waves destory each other if they're equal in power, and the team opposite to the team whose quadrant the waves collided gets energy.
Each team gets one energy per second, with 1 power in a wave taking 1 energy. Each transmission is 1 energy. Whichever side completes
their transmissions or takes down the enemy health first wins.
